## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you, although this is kinda one-sided. I'm CG360 (or just Will) and I'm an Year 12 A-Level Computer Science student based in the UK! My favourite genre of game is the Metroidvania genre if that's important. I prefer Quality > Quantity and will obsess over the little details. :)

### What do I usually work on?

I tend to work on Minecraft Server projects (Spigot + Nukkit) and the occasional game in Unity! Creative projects are some of the best but sometimes working on larger systems is fun. Quite a few of my projects, however, have been developed for the [MadBlock](https://github.com/Mooncraft-Games) Bedrock server which GuardianInASuit, DaPerson and I are working on!


### What's in development?

As of now, I'm primarily working on NewGamesAPI V2 (What a great name) over in the [NSAPI Organisation](https://github.com/NewGamesAPI-Project) along with my Computer Science coursework so some projects may take a while to be completed. The following are listed in order of priority.

- [StatTrackAPI](https://github.com/Mooncraft-Games/StatTrackAPI) - Mmm server/player stats. Gotta add an open-source DB library
- [NSAPI Commons](https://github.com/NewServerAPI-Project/NSAPICommons) - My main utility library
- [NGAPI 2.0](https://github.com/NewServerAPI-Project/NGAPI2) - version 1.0 will be opensourced with 2.0's release
- [Tabletop Boardgames Plugin](https://github.com/CloudG360/TabletopGamesPlugin) I just wanted jenga...

#### What's on hold?
- [OofTracker](https://github.com/CloudG360/OofTracker) - Too busy right now :)
- [NukkitTables](https://github.com/CloudG360/NukkitTables) - It's structurally complete, just missing a lot of vanilla conditions + functions
- [NoteblockStudio4J](https://github.com/CloudG360/NoteblockStudio4J-Live) - Probably will be rewritten

#### Completed Projects (Maintained)

- [SumoX](https://github.com/Mooncraft-Games/GamemodeSumoX) (Madblock)
- [NSAPI Map Tools](https://github.com/NewServerAPI-Project/NewServer-MapTools) (Completed MapID2. Cube16 is suspended for the time being)

#### So what are all the other repos?

I tend to keep any project with some progress up on my Github as some of the code may be reusable. Typically, they're archived once I have no intention to revisit them in the future.
