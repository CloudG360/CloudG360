### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you, although this is kinda one-sided. I'm CG360 (or just Will) and I'm an Year 12 A-Level Computer Science student based in the UK! My favourite genre of game is the Metroidvania genre if that's important.

### What do I usually work on?

I tend to work on Minecraft Server projects (Spigot + Nukkit) and the occasional game in Unity! Creative projects are some of the best but sometimes working on larger systems is fun. Quite a few of my projects, however, have been developed for the [Mooncraft Games](https://github.com/Mooncraft-Games) Bedrock server which I and GuardianInASuit are working on!


#### What's in development?

As of now, I'm primarily working on NewGamesAPI V2 (What a great name) over in the [NSAPI Organisation](https://github.com/NewGamesAPI-Project) along with my Computer Science coursework so some projects may take a while to be completed. The following are listed in order of priority.

- NSAPI Map Tools
- NGAPI 2.0 (1.0 will be opensourced with 2.0)
- NukkitTables
- SumoX (Mooncraft Games)

#### What's on hold?
- NoteblockStudio4J (Probably will be rewritten)


#### So what are all the other repos?

I tend to keep any project with some progress up on my Github as some of the code may be reusable. Typically, they're archived once I have no intention to revisit them in the future.
